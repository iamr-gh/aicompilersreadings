The following paper describes an IR and compiler in 2019. Why did they choose to create their own IR instead of using MLIR core dialects, or the MLIR dialects used by XLA(hlo) or pytorch(torch-mlir)

Short answer: In 2018–2019, when Relay was designed and published, MLIR was just being announced and did not yet provide a full, end-to-end, deep-learning compiler solution or stable, production-ready dialects covering the features Relay set out to unify. Relay’s authors wanted a single, principled, functional, statically typed IR that:

    Natively models whole programs (not just operator graphs), with first-class functions, recursion, ADTs (lists/trees), and control flow
    Tracks tensor shapes and types in a single Hindley–Milner-style type system with shape relations
    Treats operators as opaque but lowerable entities to a tensor compiler (TVM), enabling aggressive fusion/quantization by re-synthesizing kernels, not just selecting from fixed libraries
    Supports program-level optimizations (partial evaluation, fusion across nonlinear subgraphs, quantization as a rewrite/calibrate/realize pipeline) and cross-cutting analyses that need lexical scoping and effects control

More detail, mapped to what was available at the time and to design goals:

    Timing and maturity

    MLIR (publicly announced in early 2019) was infrastructure for building IR “dialects,” not an existing unified DL IR or an end-to-end compiler. Relay needed a working, integrated stack then: frontend imports, a rich mid-level IR, domain-specific passes, and codegen via TVM. The paper even positions MLIR as promising infrastructure whose dialects could be guided by Relay’s insights, but it wasn’t yet a replacement.

    Language model and expressivity

    Relay is a functional, statically typed IR with first-class functions, recursion, pattern matching, and algebraic data types. That lets it express dynamic control flow and data structures (trees/graphs/lists) cleanly, which many graph IRs struggled with or encoded via ad hoc graph constructs.
    HLO (XLA) at the time focused on tensor programs and functional op graphs with limited general-purpose language features; it was excellent for array/tensor algebra but not a whole-program IR with user-defined ADTs and higher-order functions.
    Torch IRs (TorchScript at that time) targeted a Python-like subset and had to preserve Python’s dynamic semantics; they relied on profiling and trace/graph extraction and then lowered further. Relay instead aimed for whole-program ahead-of-time compilation with static typing and shape reasoning.

    Unified type and shape system

    Relay embeds shape relations into a Hindley–Milner-style type inference engine, enabling polymorphism over shapes and static shape reasoning that many graph IRs either handled dynamically or with specialized mechanisms. This was central to optimizations like allocation planning, layout transforms, and fusion decisions.

    Operator abstraction plus TVM integration

    Relay treats ops as opaque, lowerable units backed by TVM compute expressions. Because TVM separates compute from schedule, Relay can:
        Fuse arbitrary-length chains and nonlinear patterns (diamond-shaped DAGs), then generate new fused kernels rather than selecting from a closed set
        Auto-tune those fused kernels per target
    HLO typically performed powerful algebraic and fusion optimizations but often relied on vendor libraries or its own generators; Relay’s tight integration with TVM gave it a generic path to synthesize kernels for novel fused patterns and quantized variants.

    Quantization as a compiler pass, not a fixed scheme

    Relay framed quantization as a general rewriting/calibration/realization pipeline that could be extended with per-operator rules, different bit-widths, rounding, and per-channel scaling—and then immediately fused and code-generated via TVM. Many contemporaneous stacks shipped a small set of fixed quantization schemes, with significant engineering effort per op/datatype/target combination.

    Composability of program-level passes

    Because Relay is a proper functional IR with lexical scope, it’s easier to compose standard compiler passes (CSE, DCE, constant folding) with DL-specific ones (fusion, quantization, partial evaluation, layout transforms, accelerator-specific rewrites). Traditional graph IRs split logic across Python scripting, C++ operator libraries, and graph encodings, making cross-boundary analyses harder.

    Portability across heterogeneous backends

    The Relay+TVM combo was explicitly designed to retarget CPUs, GPUs, and emerging accelerators (including FPGAs) by regenerating code for fused/quantized ops and layering accelerator-specific rewrites (e.g., axis-scale folding, bit-packing) without re-implementing large operator libraries.

Why not adopt MLIR later?

    The authors explicitly note MLIR could host interoperating dialects and that their insights could guide MLIR dialect design. But their immediate goal was a cohesive, working system with the semantics and optimization hooks they needed. Porting to MLIR would have required building multiple dialects (functional program-level IR, tensor compute, scheduling hooks) and reimplementing substantial functionality; Relay already existed and integrated with TVM.

Bottom line
Relay wasn’t just “another graph IR.” It was a whole-program, statically typed, functional IR tailored to deep learning, tightly coupled to an operator synthesis backend (TVM), enabling advanced fusion/quantization and shape-aware compilation across diverse hardware. In 2019, neither MLIR’s early dialects nor HLO/Torch IRs provided that specific combination of language semantics, optimization model, and backend integration in a mature, end-to-end form, so the authors built Relay.

how does it compare to modern alternatives now that TVM has become less popular? Are modern alternatives (ONNX, etc.) built on similar ideas, or did they do something different?

Assistant Reply:

Short take: The field moved “up” and “down” at the same time. Upstream, most big stacks standardized on MLIR-based dialects (MHLO/StableHLO, TOSA, ONNX-MLIR) for interchange and lowering, and PyTorch built a powerful ahead-of-time/JIT compiler (TorchInductor) with its own IRs plus Triton for kernel generation. Downstream, vendor runtimes (TensorRT, etc.) and library codegen dominate hot paths. TVM/Relay is still relevant academically and in some products, but for mainstream model deployment today you’re more likely to see one of: PyTorch 2.x (TorchDynamo + AOTAutograd + PrimTorch IR + TorchInductor + Triton), OpenXLA (HLO/StableHLO), IREE/MLIR, or ONNX-MLIR and ONNX Runtime.

Here’s how modern alternatives compare and whether they kept Relay’s ideas.

Where TVM/Relay stands now

    TVM’s Relay was a whole-program, statically typed functional IR with shape relations and tight integration into operator synthesis (TVM compute/schedule). That enabled fusion beyond library patterns, composable passes (quantization-as-rewrite, partial evaluation), and broad portability.
    Community direction shifted toward Relax, a newer TVM IR aimed at dynamic shapes and cross-level optimization (graph, tensor programs, external libs) while preserving symbolic shape relations and AOT deployment. Paper: Relax: Composable Abstractions for End-to-End Dynamic Machine Learning (ASPLOS ’25). Relax explicitly addresses LLM-era dynamic-shape issues and keeps the “generate fused kernels” philosophy, but with cross-level IR and first-class symbolic shape tracking.
    TVM popularity: analysts and industry posts argue TVM has struggled to keep pace with fast-evolving GPU features and GenAI kernels, as framework-native compilers (PyTorch 2.x, OpenXLA) and vendor stacks accelerated. Some core TVM contributors moved to industry; nonetheless, TVM remains actively developed, especially around Relax, TensorIR, and AutoTVM/Ansor, and still powers certain embedded/edge and custom backends.

Modern stacks and how they echo or differ from Relay’s design

    PyTorch 2.x compiler (TorchDynamo + AOTAutograd/PrimTorch + TorchInductor + Triton)

    What it is: A define-by-run capture plus multi-IR pipeline. Dynamo captures graphs from Python; AOTAutograd stabilizes forward/backward; PrimTorch/Core Aten provides a more functional op set; TorchInductor lowers to a loop-level IR and generates kernels. On GPU, it uses Triton (which itself has MLIR-like layers internally); on CPU, it emits optimized C++/OpenMP. Docs: PyTorch compiler IRs; overviews of TorchInductor and Triton.
    Similarities to Relay:
        Aggressive fusion and kernel synthesis instead of only picking fixed fused ops.
        Symbolic/dynamic shape handling through “symbolic shapes” in the capture/IR path.
        Composable passes across program layers (graph simplification, scheduling, layout, codegen).
    Differences:
        Not a single, statically typed functional IR. Instead, multiple purpose-built IRs (FX/PrimTorch/Core Aten, Inductor’s loop IR), driven by JIT/AOT capture. It prioritizes dynamic Python semantics and pragmatism over one unified typed IR.
        Kernel codegen heavily “Triton-first” for GPUs rather than TVM’s compute/schedule model.

    OpenXLA: MHLO/StableHLO and XLA

    What it is: The successor/umbrella around XLA with MHLO/StableHLO as the HLO dialects standardized for interchange and compilation. StableHLO focuses on portability and well-defined semantics across vendors; XLA provides strong fusion and algebraic optimizations and lowers to target-specific code.
    Similarities to Relay:
        Whole-graph functional modeling of tensor programs; strong fusion passes; ahead-of-time compilation; portability across backends.
        Increasing attention to dynamic shapes (StableHLO adds shape polymorphism and constraints).
    Differences:
        HLO is tensor-program centric (no user ADTs/pattern matching) and historically less “whole-program functional language” than Relay intended; the ecosystem leans on MLIR layering for control/data movement where needed.
        Operator implementations are often library- or target-integrated; kernel synthesis exists but philosophy differs from TVM’s compute/schedule split.

    IREE (MLIR-based)

    What it is: An end-to-end ML compiler that uses MLIR dialects, supports AOT, targets Vulkan, Metal, CPU, and specialized accelerators, and emphasizes deployability.
    Similarities:
        AOT, multi-level IR, dynamic shape strategies, cross-dialect optimization, portability.
    Differences:
        Built natively in the MLIR dialect ecosystem; focuses on practical deployment targets and runtimes. Less of Relay’s “general-purpose functional IR with ADTs” goal; more on standardized MLIR dialects and runtime integration.

    ONNX and ONNX-MLIR, ONNX Runtime

    What it is: ONNX remains the dominant interchange format; ONNX-MLIR compiles ONNX graphs using an MLIR-based ONNX dialect down to CPU/GPU/accelerators; ONNX Runtime orchestrates EPs (TensorRT, DirectML, OpenVINO, etc.).
    Similarities:
        Graph-level optimizations, shape inference, portability goals. ONNX-MLIR leverages MLIR for lowering and can add accelerator-specific dialects.
    Differences:
        ONNX IR is an interchange graph spec, not a general functional language; fewer language-level abstractions (no first-class functions/ADTs like Relay). Quantization is typically done via tooling and EPs rather than a unified compiler-rewriting-calibrate-realize flow, though ONNX-MLIR and runtimes support quantization paths.

    Vendor and domain-specific stacks

    NVIDIA TensorRT, Microsoft DirectML, Intel oneDNN/oneAPI, Apple’s Metal Performance Shaders, Qualcomm, etc. These focus on deployment/runtime with strong kernel libraries and selected compilation/fusion. They don’t adopt Relay’s “single functional IR” model; instead they provide fast, often closed, backends that compilers target.

Which ideas “won” from Relay?

    Yes, in spirit:
        Treating quantization, layout, memory planning, and fusion as compiler transforms, not ad hoc per-op hacks, is now mainstream (PyTorch 2.x compiler, OpenXLA, IREE, ONNX-MLIR pipelines).
        Cross-level optimization with shape reasoning and dynamic shapes is front-and-center (symbolic shapes in PyTorch; StableHLO dynamic-shape efforts; Relax’s first-class symbolic shapes).
        Kernel synthesis/fusion beyond prepackaged library ops is the norm again (Triton in Inductor, XLA fusion/codegen, TVM/Relax/TensorIR).
    Less so:
        A single, statically typed, ML-style functional IR with ADTs and first-class recursion as the centerpiece hasn’t become the common denominator. Most stacks use multiple IRs optimized for specific phases and keep user-level generality in the host framework (Python), with JIT/AOT capture and specialization.

If you were choosing in 2025

    When you are primarily in the PyTorch ecosystem and want strong performance with minimal friction: PyTorch 2.x’s torch.compile (TorchDynamo + Inductor + Triton) is the default path.
    If you want a portable, framework-agnostic interchange with a compiler: ONNX → ONNX-MLIR or ONNX Runtime with the right execution providers.
    If you want a standardized compiler IR across vendors and close integration with TPU/XLA ecosystems: OpenXLA (StableHLO/MHLO + XLA).
    If you want MLIR-native, AOT, embedded/edge and Vulkan/Metal targeting: IREE.
    If you need custom kernel synthesis across diverse hardware, or you’re doing research and exotic backends including FPGAs: TVM with Relax and TensorIR remains compelling.

Bottom line

    Modern alternatives embraced many of Relay’s core principles—shape-aware compilation, cross-level optimization, aggressive fusion, and code synthesis—but implemented them as layered pipelines (often MLIR-based) or as framework-native compilers with multiple IRs (PyTorch 2.x). ONNX serves as the lingua franca graph format rather than a general-purpose functional IR. TVM’s successor IR (Relax) updates Relay’s ideas for dynamic shapes and cross-level optimization in the LLM era.

what optimizations could be done within Relay's IR, before it was lowered to something more hardware specific
Attach
Assistant Reply:

Here are the main classes of optimizations Relay could (and did) perform at the IR level, before lowering ops to hardware-specific code via TVM or other backends. I’ve grouped them into general compiler optimizations, DL-specific graph/tensor optimizations, type/shape-driven rewrites, and accelerator-oriented but still IR-level transforms.

General, whole-program compiler optimizations

    Constant folding and propagation: Evaluate pure subexpressions (including tensor constants and small pure ops) at compile time.
    Common subexpression elimination (CSE): Reuse results across let-bound expressions, aided by lexical scoping.
    Dead code elimination (DCE): Remove unused bindings and branches proven unreachable.
    Inlining (selective): Inline small functions to expose fusion and constant folding opportunities; avoid code bloat with heuristics.
    Partial evaluation: Reduce partially static programs (loop unrolling when bounds are known; specialize higher-order combinators); preserves effect ordering via A-normal form.
    Beta/eta reductions and simplifications: Normalize functional structure to simplify subsequent analyses.
    Control-flow simplification: If-then-else pruning when predicates become constants; simplify matches on known ADT constructors.

Shape- and type-driven analyses/rewrites

    Type and shape inference with relations: Infer tensor dtypes/shapes; discharge constraints to enable layout planning and buffer sizing.
    Shape specialization: Clone/specialize functions for known shapes (including polymorphic shape constraints), enabling downstream codegen and fusion.
    Layout normalization/transformation: Choose or rewrite between layouts (e.g., NCHW ↔ NHWC, channels last) to improve memory locality; push required transposes to the edges and cancel them where possible.
    Broadcasting normalization: Canonicalize elementwise broadcasting to enable fusion and constant folding.
    Memory planning at the graph level: Lifetime analysis to reuse buffers, pre-allocate outputs, and minimize intermediate allocations (still IR-level decisions before kernel scheduling).

Deep-learning–specific graph/tensor optimizations

    Operator fusion (IR extraction): Identify fusion-eligible subgraphs (chains, diamonds, fan-in/fan-out) and abstract them into primitive functions to be lowered as a single fused op later.
    Algebraic simplifications: Remove neutral/absorbing ops (add 0, mul 1), fold consecutive reshapes/transposes, collapse consecutive activations when mathematically equivalent, simplify BN patterns when constants allow.
    Constant folding with tensors: Precompute parts of conv/linear if weights/constants allow (e.g., fold bias adds; pre-apply scales).
    Redundant op elimination around ReLU/clip: Remove superfluous clips when ranges imply dominance.
    Common pattern canonicalization: Normalize conv+bn+relu or matmul+add+gelu patterns to a canonical form to improve matching/fusion downstream.

Quantization pipeline (still IR-level)

    Annotation: Insert simulated quantization nodes (simQ) per operator policy (per-tensor or per-channel, chosen bit-widths/rounding).
    Calibration: Run data-driven or heuristic passes to pick scales/zero-points (global, per-layer, per-channel; MSE, KL, overflow-safe, etc.).
    Realization: Rewrite simQ to concrete cast/round/clip/mul/div sequences; then enable fusion so scales/quantize/dequantize ops get absorbed into surrounding ops.
    Mixed-precision propagation: Track and propagate precisions across the IR; choose where to keep higher precision accumulators.

Control-flow and data-structure aware rewrites

    Loop transformations via recursion or combinators: Unroll/specialize small or statically bounded loops; hoist invariants out of loops; convert while-like TF constructs into specialized recursive functions enabling more analysis.
    Pattern-matching simplifications on ADTs: When shapes/sizes are known, prune branches or pre-construct results; useful for tree/list models (e.g., TreeLSTM).
    Effect-aware duplication control: Keep A-normal form to avoid duplicating effectful reads (refs) while enabling pure-part optimizations.

Scheduling-enabling canonicalizations (pre-lowering)

    Producer/consumer locality improvements: Reorder let-bindings to increase chances of fusion and buffer reuse without changing semantics.
    Inline small elementwise producers into consumers: Mark candidates for later fused kernel generation.
    Boundary placement of transposes/reshapes: Push/pull layout changes to graph boundaries or constant-weight edges, enabling constant-time precomputation.

Accelerator-oriented but IR-level transforms

    Axis-scale folding: Move scalar multiplications across conv/linear to the constant weight side; then fold into weights at compile time (important for accelerators lacking scalar multiplies).
    Parallel convolution combination: Combine multiple sibling convs sharing the same input (e.g., Inception branches) into a single wider op to reduce launches/overheads downstream.
    Packing-friendly rewrites: Introduce explicit pack/unpack nodes (e.g., int4/bitser) around weights/activations at IR level so downstream lowering can generate packed kernels.
    Precision- and datatype normalization: Convert mixed layouts/dtypes to a set preferred by the target while preserving semantics; leave hooks for later per-target lowering.

Interprocedural and modular optimizations

    Function specialization: Specialize higher-order functions and polymorphic functions for concrete op sets and shapes.
    Interprocedural CSE and constant propagation: Share common subgraphs across call sites.
    Closure conversion (if needed): Prepare first-class functions for VM/AOT targets.

Diagnostics and legality checks (supporting optimizations)

    Op legality and constraint checks: Ensure fused groups obey shape/stride/broadcast rules and that quantization contracts hold.
    Cost modeling at IR level: Heuristics to decide fusion boundaries, unrolling limits, and when to keep or remove layout transforms.

These IR-level optimizations set up the program so that, when Relay lowers each primitive/fused op to TVM compute, the backend can:

    Generate specialized fused kernels
    Pick or auto-tune schedules per target
    Reap benefits from reduced intermediates, better layouts, and quantized arithmetic

If you have a workload in mind (e.g., CNNs, transformers, tree-structured models, or dynamic-shape LLMs), I can outline a recommended Relay pass pipeline tailored to it.

how different do linalg and tensor dialects look from what Relay did
Attach
Assistant Reply:

High-level summary:

    Relay is a single, high-level, statically typed functional IR for whole programs (functions, recursion, ADTs, control flow) with tensor types and shape relations; ops are opaque and later lowered to a tensor-kernel generator (TVM).
    MLIR’s tensor and linalg dialects are lower in the stack and purpose-built for tensor/loop program representation and transformation. They are not whole-program languages; they are building blocks in a multi-dialect pipeline.

Key differences

    Language model and scope

    Relay:
        Whole-program functional IR: first-class functions, recursion, if/match, ADTs, refs.
        Statically typed with Hindley–Milner-like inference extended with shape relations.
        Designed to express entire DL models and run program-level analyses before lowering ops.
    MLIR tensor + linalg:
        Tensor dialect: pure SSA values with ranked/unranked tensor types, shape polymorphism via symbols, and ops like reshape, cast, extract/insert_slice. No functions/ADTs/control flow at this level (functions exist via MLIR’s func/cf dialects, but higher-level language features are outside tensor/linalg).
        linalg dialect: library of structured ops (matmul, conv, generic) over tensors or memrefs, expressing computations via indexed maps and iteration spaces. It is a kernel-level abstraction geared toward tiling, fusion, vectorization. Control/program structure comes from other dialects.

    Operator abstraction and code generation

    Relay:
        “Operator” is opaque at the Relay level; actual compute lives in TVM compute/schedule. Relay fuses subgraphs, then hands the fused op to TVM to synthesize a kernel and schedule (with autotuning).
    linalg/tensor:
        Ops are explicit compute IR. linalg.generic encodes loop nests via indexing maps and iterator types; transformations (tile, fuse, interchange, vectorize) are mechanical rewrites on IR.
        Codegen proceeds via bufferization to memrefs, tiling/packing, vector/mma dialects, and then to LLVM, GPU, or vendor backends. There’s no separate “TVM schedule”; schedules are expressed as IR rewrites/patterns.

    Shapes and types

    Relay:
        Tensor types carry base dtype and shape; shape variables and arithmetic appear in type relations solved by a constraint solver. Shape reasoning is part of type inference.
    tensor/linalg:
        RankedTensorType carries shape (possibly dynamic dims). Symbolic shapes are modeled via affine/shape dialects and function signatures; legality is checked by verifier/canonicalizers, not a Hindley–Milner engine.
        Shape computations can be explicit ops (shape dialect) or encoded in affine maps. No global HM-style inference; instead, rewrites/canonicalization and verifier constraints are used.

    Control flow and data structures

    Relay:
        if/match, recursion, ADTs (lists/trees), and refs are first-class, enabling models like TreeLSTM to be direct.
    tensor/linalg:
        No ADTs; control flow (cf/scf dialects) supports structured loops and conditionals but not algebraic data types. Tree-like models would be represented either at a higher dialect (e.g., torch, TOSA, StableHLO) and lowered to tensor/linalg once control/data structures are removed or specialized.

    Fusion philosophy

    Relay:
        Graph-level fusion across arbitrary nonlinear dataflow (chains, diamonds). Produces “primitive functions” representing fused regions, later turned into single kernels by TVM.
    linalg:
        Fusion is loop- and tile-based: compose producers/consumers by rewriting linalg ops to share iteration spaces or inline producers into consumers, guided by dependence analysis. It’s more structural and closer to loops than “fuse arbitrary graph nodes and ask a kernel generator.”

    Quantization

    Relay:
        Compiler-native quantization pipeline: annotate → calibrate → realize; scales/round/cast modeled as IR ops, then fused into kernels via TVM.
    MLIR:
        Quantization typically uses the quant dialect and passes that insert q/dq or uniform quantized types, and then legalize to target dialects. It’s integrated but more datatype-schema–driven than Relay’s original “simQ → realize” flow; calibration is done via tooling/passes rather than a Relay-like meta-operator.

    Partial evaluation and higher-order transforms

    Relay:
        Partial evaluator over a functional core (A-normal form), can unroll, specialize, fold effects-aware, and simplify matches.
    MLIR tensor/linalg:
        Not designed for higher-order PE. Transformations are pattern-based rewrites, affine analyses, and cost-driven tiling/fusion; higher-order functionality happens in higher dialects or frameworks before lowering.

    Integration position in a stack

    Relay:
        One IR intended to sit above kernel generation, doing both “graph” and “language” level optimizations, then lowering ops to TVM and leaving only orchestration/control to the runtime or VM.
    MLIR tensor/linalg:
        Mid/low-level layers in a multi-dialect pipeline. High-level frameworks/dialects (Torch, StableHLO, TOSA, ONNX) lower into tensor/linalg; then bufferize → vector/GPU/LLVM.

What looks similar conceptually

    Both emphasize:
        Static shapes when possible, with symbolic/dynamic shapes supported.
        Systematic fusion and canonicalization before codegen.
        A separation between “what” (compute spec) and “how” (schedule/tiling). Relay did this via TVM; linalg does it via transform dialect/patterns and vector/GPU dialects.
    But linalg/tensor are more prescriptive about compute structure (iteration spaces, indexing maps) and less about whole-program semantics.

When to use which (today)

    If you’re building inside MLIR: use a high-level dialect (Torch, StableHLO, TOSA, ONNX) → tensor/linalg for compute → bufferization → vector/GPU/LLVM. You get first-class support for tiling/fusion/vectorization and many backends.
    If you want a single functional IR with strong type/shape inference and tight TVM kernel synthesis: Relay (or its successor in TVM, Relax) gives that model; it’s attractive for research, exotic backends, or systems that prefer TVM’s scheduling/autotuning.

Bottom line
Relay and MLIR’s tensor/linalg sit at different abstraction levels. Relay is a whole-program, typed, functional IR with domain-specific mechanisms (shape relations, quantization, partial eval) designed to hand fused regions to a kernel synthesizer. MLIR’s tensor/linalg are compute- and loop-structured IRs inside a multi-dialect compilation pipeline; they expect higher dialects to have already removed language-level constructs and express computation as structured tensor ops ready for tiling, fusion, vectorization, and lowering.

what are modern technologies that compare to relay? is it something like the frontends of tesnorflow and torch 2 themselves?

Closest modern counterparts to Relay (conceptually and in role)

Relay was a whole-program, statically typed, functional IR that:

    captured full models (functions, control flow, data structures)
    did graph- and program-level optimizations (fusion, quantization, partial eval, layout)
    then synthesized kernels via a tensor compiler (TVM)

Today, no single dominant IR mirrors Relay exactly, but several stacks cover most of the same ground in different ways.

Framework-native compilers (most similar in role)

    PyTorch 2.x compiler stack
        Components: TorchDynamo (graph capture), AOTAutograd, PrimTorch/Core ATen IRs (more functional op set), TorchInductor (lowering/fusion), Triton (GPU kernel synthesis) or C++/OpenMP (CPU).
        Why it’s comparable: Does end-to-end capture and optimization of models, aggressive fusion, dynamic/symbolic shapes, and kernel synthesis. Multiple IRs instead of one “Relay,” but functionally fills the same slot for PyTorch users.

    OpenXLA (XLA + StableHLO/MHLO)
        Components: StableHLO/MHLO as whole-graph tensor IRs; XLA does algebraic simplification, fusion, layout, and lowers to target backends.
        Why comparable: Ahead-of-time compilation for full models with strong fusion and portability (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs). Less of Relay’s “general functional language with ADTs,” but similar in optimizing graph before codegen.

MLIR-based end-to-end compilers

    IREE
        Uses MLIR dialects to compile from StableHLO/Torch/ONNX-like inputs through tensor/linalg to CPU/GPU/Vulkan/Metal/accelerators; supports AOT deployment and dynamic shapes.
        Comparable because it’s a unified IR stack doing program-level and tensor-level transforms, then generating kernels/runtimes.

    ONNX-MLIR (+ ONNX Runtime)
        ONNX-MLIR lowers ONNX graphs via MLIR to targets; ONNX Runtime orchestrates execution providers (TensorRT, OpenVINO, DirectML, etc.).
        Comparable in portability and graph optimization, but more of an interchange + multi-backend runtime than a single Relay-like IR with language features.

TVM’s own evolution (closest philosophically)

    TVM Relax + TensorIR
        Relax is TVM’s newer IR designed for dynamic shapes and cross-level optimization (graph, tensor programs, external libs) while preserving symbolic shape reasoning; TensorIR is the loop-level kernel IR/scheduler.
        This is the direct successor to Relay’s ideas, modernized for LLM/dynamic workloads. If you’re thinking “Relay, but updated,” Relax is it.

Other notable pieces

    JAX + XLA: JAX traces Python functions to HLO; XLA compiles. Similar to “Relay as mid-level IR” but with HLO as the IR and Python tracing on top.
    TOSA (MLIR dialect): A portable op set for inference; typically an intermediate target that then lowers to linalg/vector/GPU. Not a whole-program IR like Relay.
    Vendor compilers: NVIDIA TensorRT, Apple Core ML Tools, Intel OpenVINO, Microsoft DirectML. Strong optimizers/fusion/quantization, but closed or target-specific; more “backends” than Relay-like mid-level IRs.

So, is it “like the frontends of TensorFlow and Torch 2”?

    In spirit, yes—modern framework-native compiler frontends (PyTorch 2.x’s capture stack; JAX tracing; TF’s MLIR-based pipelines into XLA) are the parts that gather a whole model, apply model-level optimizations, and hand off to a lower-level kernel/codegen layer. Relay played that role in TVM.
    Differences:
        Relay was a single, statically typed functional IR with shape relations and ADTs; PyTorch/TF stacks use multiple IRs and rely on Python tracing or MLIR dialects, with dynamic shape machinery and mixed AOT/JIT strategies.
        Kernel synthesis backend differs: Triton/XLA/MLIR linalg in modern stacks vs TVM compute/schedule in Relay.

If you want a Relay-like choice today

    PyTorch 2.x compiler (for PyTorch workloads; Triton-backed kernel synthesis)
    OpenXLA + StableHLO (for TPU/multi-backend graph AOT)
    IREE (MLIR-native, deployable to many targets)
    TVM Relax + TensorIR (research/custom backends, TVM ecosystem)
    ONNX-MLIR or ONNX Runtime (interchange + broad backend coverage; less of a “language,” more orchestration)

Bottom line
Relay’s role—whole-model IR optimization followed by kernel synthesis—is now split across well-supported pipelines. PyTorch 2.x and OpenXLA/IREE are the most widely used “modern Relays,” while TVM’s Relax is the direct spiritual successor within the TVM project.

What neural network libraries were able to target Relay? were there ever any dedicated language packages for working with it, or was it mostly downstream of torch and tensorflow?

Assistant Reply:

Short answer: Relay mostly sat downstream of existing frameworks. The TVM project provided importers/frontends from several popular ecosystems into Relay, and people typically authored models in those ecosystems (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, MXNet, ONNX), then converted to Relay for optimization and deployment. There were not widely adopted, standalone “Relay-first” user libraries or a big dedicated language community around writing Relay by hand.

What targeted Relay in practice

    PyTorch
        Through PyTorch’s JIT/FX frontends, models could be exported and imported into TVM/Relay. Earlier paths used TorchScript; later work leveraged torch.fx.
    TensorFlow
        TensorFlow graphs (including some control flow constructs) were imported via the TVM TensorFlow frontend. There was also support for TFLite models.
    MXNet (Gluon)
        TVM originally came out of the same lab that built MXNet; the NNVM frontend (predecessor to Relay) and later the MXNet importer were well supported.
    ONNX
        A major route: export from many frameworks to ONNX, then import ONNX into Relay. This was a common, framework-agnostic path.
    Keras, Darknet, Caffe
        TVM maintained importers for several of these formats, typically by converting them to an intermediate (often ONNX) or directly into Relay.
    TVM’s own Python/C++ builders
        You could construct Relay programs directly via the TVM Python API (relay frontend API) or use the Relay text format, but this was mostly for compiler developers and advanced users rather than the mainstream authoring flow.

Were there dedicated language packages for Relay?

    Minimal and niche. Relay had:
        A textual IR and Python/C++ APIs to build/manipulate Relay ASTs.
        An interpreter/VM and an ahead-of-time compiler within TVM for running Relay.
        Some experimental tutorials and examples demonstrating direct Relay authoring, ADTs, control flow, etc.
    But there wasn’t a popular, standalone “Relay language” package or DSL (like, say, a thriving Julia/Scala/Python-first language binding specifically for writing Relay models). The norm was to write models in PyTorch/TF/etc. and import.

Notable evolution within TVM

    Relax IR is the successor aimed at dynamic shapes and LLM-era needs. Recent TVM work focuses on Relax + TensorIR. As with Relay, most usage still originates from mainstream frameworks (PyTorch via torch-frontend/FX, ONNX, etc.), not from hand-writing Relax.

Bottom line

    Primary sources into Relay: PyTorch, TensorFlow, MXNet, ONNX (plus a handful of other model zoos via importers).
    Authoring directly in Relay was possible but uncommon; there weren’t widely used, dedicated language packages for everyday model development. Most users treated Relay as TVM’s mid-level compiler IR sitting downstream of popular training frameworks.
