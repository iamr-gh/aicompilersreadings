what is a CU masked stream?
eclip.pdf
Assistant Reply:

A “CU masked stream” is a GPU command stream that is restricted to run only on a specified subset of the GPU’s Compute Units (CUs).

    CU = Compute Unit (AMD’s equivalent of NVIDIA’s SM).
    Masked = you provide a mask (bitset/selection) indicating which CUs are allowed for kernels in that stream.
    Stream = the queue/context through which kernels are dispatched.

On AMD GPUs via ROCm/HIP, CU masking enables spatial partitioning: different streams can be bound to disjoint CU sets so co-located workloads run concurrently with less interference. In ECLIP, they pre-allocate several CU‑masked streams (e.g., 15, 30, 45 CU configurations aligned to shader engines) and then route kernels to these streams to avoid per-kernel repartitioning overhead while controlling resource sharing.

is a similar technology available on Nvidia GPUs?
Assistant Reply:

Short answer: sort of—yes, but not exactly the same or as convenient.

On NVIDIA, you have three relevant options:

    MIG (Multi‑Instance GPU): Hardware partitions on Ampere/Hopper/Blackwell data‑center parts. Creates isolated GPU instances with dedicated SMs/L2/memory bandwidth. It’s process/VM/container level, static while in use, not per‑stream or per‑kernel.
    MPS with execution resource provisioning: Lets you cap an MPS client’s share of SMs (e.g., CUDA_MPS_ACTIVE_THREAD_PERCENTAGE). It’s coarse, not strictly enforced to a fixed SM set, and doesn’t give you per‑stream SM masks.
    libsmctrl / nvtaskset (research tools): Use undocumented or reverse‑engineered mechanisms to set SM masks per process/stream/kernel on many NVIDIA GPUs. They can approximate “SM‑masked streams,” but require integrating a library/tool and aren’t officially supported by NVIDIA.

So, AMD’s CU‑masked streams (official, per‑stream masks in ROCm) don’t have a direct, officially supported CUDA equivalent. Closest official: MIG (strong isolation, coarse/static) and MPS provisioning (softer, coarse). Closest functional match: libsmctrl/nvtaskset, with caveats about support and maintenance.

is this paper then only meaningful on AMD GPUs?
Assistant Reply:

Mostly, but not only.

    Why it fits AMD best: ECLIP relies on ROCm’s official CU masking at the stream level, plus specific queue/barrier behavior and shader-engine groupings (15 CUs/SE on MI50). The implementation and measured overheads (IOCTL costs, HSA queue oversubscription limits, barrier packet costs) are AMD-specific.

    What generalizes:
        The core idea—kernel-wise right-sizing via a small pool of preallocated spatial partitions to cut repartitioning overhead—applies broadly.
        The scheduling principles (limit partition switches, enforce dependencies cheaply, fairness to avoid energy waste from idle resources) are vendor-agnostic.
        The optimization framing (offline ILP to choose a few partition points per request; budget for partition switches) can be adapted to other platforms.

    NVIDIA today:
        Direct per-stream masking isn’t officially exposed like ROCm CU masks, so you can’t drop ECLIP in as-is.
        With MIG, you could emulate a coarser version (static instances per worker), losing kernel-grain agility.
        With MPS resource caps, you get softer, non-deterministic SM sharing—again coarser than ECLIP’s target.
        Research tools like libsmctrl/nvtaskset can approximate SM-masked streams, but are unofficial, may break across driver releases, and require invasive integration. An ECLIP-like approach could be prototyped on NVIDIA using these, but it wouldn’t be production-stable.

    Other vendors/contexts:
        Any GPU/runtime that supports stable, low-overhead spatial partitioning at sub-device granularity and multiple queues could adopt the approach.
        The “preallocate partitions; route kernels; limit switches” recipe is useful even for CPU core pinning or accelerator tiles if similar mechanisms exist.

Bottom line: The paper’s concrete system and results are AMD-specific, but the methodology and insights are broadly useful. Porting to NVIDIA would need different mechanisms (MIG/MPS or unofficial SM masking) and would likely deliver coarser granularity or require unsupported hooks.

are there similar projects aimed at reducing energy consumption on nvidia gpus?

Assistant Reply:

Yes—there’s a growing body of NVIDIA-focused work to cut inference energy, though the mechanisms differ from AMD CU masking. Examples:

    Spatial partitioning/co-location on NVIDIA
        PARIS + ELSA (MIG-based): Uses NVIDIA MIG to create heterogeneous GPU partitions and an elastic scheduler to boost utilization and reduce waste for inference servers. Coarser-grain than per-stream masking but practical on A100/H100/B200.
        MPS-based SM allocation: Research frameworks tune CUDA MPS active thread percentage to find energy-optimal SM splits between co-located jobs, improving requests-per-watt over equal sharing.
        libsmctrl/nvtaskset (research/unsupported): Per-process/stream SM masks using undocumented hooks; can approximate “SM-masked streams,” but not production-safe.

    DVFS and frequency control for LLM inference
        throttLL’eM: SLO-aware GPU frequency and instance scaling; up to ~44% energy reduction versus default serving while meeting SLOs.
        GreenLLM: Separates prefill vs. decode, applies queueing-aware freq selection and online control; reports up to ~34% energy savings with minimal SLO impact.
        Other DVFS modeling/tuners: Empirical GPU DVFS latency models for DNNs; RL-based adaptive GPU frequency tuning; studies showing up to ~30–40% savings under suitable workloads.

    Cluster/MIG placement and scheduling
        Optimal Workload Placement on Multi-Instance GPUs: Optimization/heuristics to pack workloads into MIG slices to minimize GPU count and wastage (indirect energy benefit via higher utilization).

Takeaway:

    On NVIDIA, energy gains commonly come from MIG/MPS partitioning (coarser than AMD’s per-stream CU masks) plus DVFS-aware serving. While you don’t get official per-stream SM masks, combining smart co-location (MIG/MPS) with SLO-aware frequency control can deliver meaningful energy savings in production. If you can tolerate research tooling, libsmctrl enables finer-grain masking experiments, but it’s not officially supported.

what models did ECLIP test on? are these comparable to modern LLMs? How effective is such an approach compared to dedicated hardware like TPU

    Models ECLIP tested
    The paper evaluates seven vision/NLP inference models commonly used as DNN benchmarks (not large language models):
        albert
        densenet201
        alexnet
        resnet15
        resnext101
        shufflenet
        vgg19
        They form seven co-location mixes (e.g., multiple albert/densenet/vgg19 workers) and measure throughput, tail latency (p95), and energy efficiency on an AMD MI50 (60 CUs).

    Are these comparable to modern LLMs?
    Not really. These are mostly CNNs and a compact transformer (ALBERT) with relatively short kernel times and smaller memory footprints compared to modern LLMs (e.g., 7B–70B+ parameters). Key differences:
        Working set and memory bandwidth: LLMs stress HBM capacity/bandwidth and KV cache growth during decoding; CNNs typically have smaller activation footprints per request.
        Execution patterns: LLM serving has a prefill phase (highly parallel GEMMs) and a decode phase (smaller batch, cache-bound, kernel microseconds), with strong scheduler sensitivity; CNN inference is more uniform.
        Parallelism and tensor cores: LLMs rely heavily on tensor cores, fused attention, quantization, and sequence-level batching.
        Because of this, ECLIP’s exact results don’t directly translate to LLM serving. However, some ideas carry over:
        Preallocate a small pool of spatial partitions; route kernels/ops to avoid frequent repartitioning.
        Limit partition switches; enforce dependencies efficiently.
        Right-size resources per phase or op group to increase utilization and reduce idle leakage.

    How effective is this approach vs. dedicated hardware like TPU?
    Different trade-space:
        TPUs (and similar AI accelerators) offer tightly integrated systolic arrays, compiler-controlled execution, and strong power efficiency for dense matmul/attention. For large-scale transformer inference, TPUs often achieve higher performance-per-watt than general-purpose GPUs at similar process nodes.
        ECLIP targets improving energy efficiency on commodity GPUs via software/runtime scheduling. Reported gains:
            Throughput: up to ~21% (average ~13%)
            Energy efficiency (requests per watt): up to ~35% (average ~25%)
            Tail latency kept in check by budgeting partition switches
            These are meaningful improvements within the GPU platform you already operate. They won’t turn a GPU into a TPU in absolute perf/W, but they can narrow the gap by better utilizing the GPU and avoiding waste from idle resources and heavy reconfiguration overhead.

Practical guidance:

    For CNNs and medium-sized transformer workloads on AMD GPUs, ECLIP-like strategies can deliver double-digit % gains in throughput and energy efficiency without model changes.
    For modern LLM serving:
        On AMD: You’d need LLM-aware grouping (prefill vs. decode), attention kernel characteristics, and careful handling of many microsecond-scale kernels to keep barrier/switch overhead in check.
        On NVIDIA: There’s no official per-stream SM masking; a practical variant would combine MIG/MPS for coarser spatial partitioning with SLO-aware DVFS, batching, and quantization. Unofficial tools (e.g., libsmctrl) can approximate finer-grain masking but aren’t production-stable.
    Versus TPUs: If you can choose hardware and your workload is dominated by large transformers, TPUs often win in perf/W. If you’re standardized on GPUs, ECLIP-style co-location and right-sizing are low-hanging, software-side gains you can stack with batching, quantization, tensor-core–optimized kernels, and frequency scaling.
